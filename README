What is this?
====================================================================
This R package creates portmanteau-style passwords, as in this XKCD
comic: https://xkcd.com/936/

Rather than using a dictionary, a random Wikipedia page is used for
the "dictionary".  Then, a random selection of words is chosen for
the password.  See package documentation for details.



How do I install it?
====================================================================
To install the package from github, I recommend using Hadley 
Wickham's devtools package, which you can get from the CRAN.  After
installing that, you can enter

library(devtools)
install_github(repo="xkcdpw", username="wrathematics")

into an R terminal to install this package.  You can also install 
the package a simple via:

R CMD INSTALL xkcdpw_0.1.tar.gz
