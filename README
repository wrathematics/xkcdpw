This R package creates portmanteau-style passwords, as in this XKCD comic:
https://xkcd.com/936/

Rather than using a dictionary, a random Wikipedia page is used for the 
"dictionary".  Then, a random selection of words is chosen for the password.
See package documentation for details.

The package should install via 
R CMD INSTALL xkcdpw_0.1.tar.gz, 
or via the devtools package by way of:
install_github(repo="xkcdpw", username="wrathematics")
